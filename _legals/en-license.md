This License Notice sets forth the rights, obligations, and limitations applicable to the use of all content, assets, and software available on the **dayverse.id** website ("Website"). An understanding of the following terms is a prerequisite for the fair and lawful use of the Website and for the protection of the intellectual property rights of all parties involved.

### **1\. Site and General Content License**

All elements that are an integral part of this Website—including but not limited to the logo, brand identity, visual design, information architecture, layout structure, user interface, and article texts (unless otherwise explicitly stated)—are the exclusive intellectual property of **dayverse.id**. These elements are protected by applicable copyright and intellectual property laws. Any form of use, reproduction, modification, or distribution of these elements without our prior written consent is strictly prohibited and may result in legal consequences.

Furthermore, articles on this Website, particularly those in a tutorial format, may display the names, logos, or visual representations (screenshots) of third-party software. All trademarks, trade names, and copyrights associated with such software are the property of their respective owners. The mention or visual display of these is solely for the purposes of identification, education, review, and commentary within the scope of fair use, and does not imply any affiliation, endorsement, or sponsorship from us towards the trademark-holding entity, nor vice versa.

### **2\. Creative Asset License**

This Website provides a variety of design and animation materials ("Assets") for use by the User in their projects.

* **Scope of Use:** The User is granted a non-exclusive, worldwide right to use the Assets in any project, whether for personal (non-commercial) or for-profit (commercial) purposes. This includes, but is not limited to, videos, web designs, marketing materials, and other creative works. The "non-exclusive" nature of this license means that while you have the right to use an Asset, other Users are granted the same right, and no single User will ever have sole ownership or exclusive rights to any Asset provided on this Website.  
* **Attribution:** Attribution or credit to **dayverse.id** or **Nurimator** is not required but is greatly appreciated as a form of recognition for the work provided.  
* **Distribution Prohibition:** The User is strictly prohibited from redistributing, reselling, or making the Assets available for download separately (standalone) on other platforms. This provision aims to protect intellectual property integrity, ensure Assets are obtained from a legitimate source, and prevent the spread of potentially outdated or modified versions without permission. If the User wishes to share an Asset, they are required to provide a reference or a direct link to the original source page on the **dayverse.id** Website.  
* **Minecraft-Related Assets:** **dayverse.id** is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Mojang Studios or Microsoft. NOT AN OFFICIAL MINECRAFT PRODUCT. NOT APPROVED BY OR ASSOCIATED WITH MOJANG OR MICROSOFT. All Minecraft-related Assets displayed on this Website are used in accordance with the Minecraft Usage Guidelines. All related trademarks remain the property of their respective owners.

### **3\. Web Application (Web App) License**

The web applications available on this Website are governed by two distinct types of licenses, which determine the User's level of freedom:

* **Proprietary Software Applications:** Applications not explicitly marked as *Open Source* are proprietary software belonging to **dayverse.id** and are fully protected by copyright law. The source code of these applications is confidential and constitutes a trade secret. Therefore, the User is prohibited from reverse-engineering, decompiling, disassembling, or redistributing the application's source code for any purpose.  
* **Open Source Applications:** Applications expressly marked as *Open Source* are licensed under the terms of the **GNU Affero General Public License version 3.0 (AGPLv3)**.

#### **Summary of the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPLv3)**

The AGPLv3 is a strong copyleft license designed to ensure the freedom of software accessed over a network. The fundamental points of this license are as follows:

* **User Freedoms:** The license grants the User the right to run, study, share, and modify the software. Access to the source code is a prerequisite for these freedoms.  
* **Reciprocal Obligation (Copyleft):** If a User distributes a modified version of the AGPLv3-licensed software, the User is obligated to release the source code of their modifications under the same AGPLv3 license. This ensures that the freedoms received are passed on to subsequent users.  
* **Network Access Provision:** This is the core clause of the AGPL. If a User runs a modified version of the software on a server and allows other users to interact with it over a network (e.g., as a public web service), the User must provide those network users with access to the complete source code of the modified version.  
* **Disclaimer of Warranty:** The software is provided "as is" without any warranty, whether regarding performance, security, or fitness for a particular purpose. The risk of use is borne entirely by the User.

### **4\. User-Generated Content License and Responsibility**

The User retains sole ownership rights to the original content they create ("User Content") through the services or Assets provided. By creating User Content, the User acknowledges and agrees to the following terms:

* **Legal Responsibility:** The User bears all legal responsibility for the User Content they create, including ensuring that such content does not violate any laws, contain hate speech, infringe upon third-party intellectual property rights (e.g., music or image copyrights), or constitute defamation.  
* **Indemnification:** The User agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless **dayverse.id** from any and all claims, demands, losses, or damages (including reasonable attorney's fees) arising from or in connection with said User Content. This means that if a third party brings a legal claim against us because of the Content you created, you are responsible for bearing the legal and financial consequences.
