## About Nurimator


Nurimator is the name I use as a Minecraft animation content creator, with a primary focus on the software Mine-imator. I started creating animations in June 2018, simply out of curiosity and interest. Over time, animation became a significant part of my daily life and something Iâ€™ve continued to explore seriously.

## From Hobby to Purpose

In 2020, I restarted everything under the name Nurimator with a clearer direction. I no longer just wanted to create animations but also to help others who wanted to learn. When I first started, tutorials were difficult to find, assets were limited, and technical information was rarely available, especially in Indonesian. These challenges motivated me to build a more structured and accessible learning resource.

## What I Do

My work now goes beyond animation. I also develop educational content for Mine-imator, create downloadable rigs and assets, explain technical features in detail, and explore both visual and process-based aspects of animation.

Although I work extensively in animation, I do not have a formal background in animation studies. I am a self-taught learner with a broad interest in many fields. I enjoy learning about design, technology, science, web development, and sometimes things that have no direct connection to animation at all.

## Why This Matters

I believe that learning shouldn't be limited by formal education or background. Often, the biggest barrier is not ability but access. Through Nurimator, I aim to offer clear, structured content and free resources that make learning animation more approachable for anyone, regardless of where they start.
