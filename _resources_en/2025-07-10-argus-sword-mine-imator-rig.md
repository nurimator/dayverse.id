## Overview

This rig features the sword of Argus from the game *Mobile Legends: Bang Bang*, designed specifically for animation use in *Mine-imator*. The rig includes only the weapon model and is created to be easy to implement in various Minecraft-themed projects. Each version has been adjusted to match the shape and visual style of the original design, while still fitting naturally within the blocky look of Minecraft animations.

Argus is known as a Fighter-type hero with a unique backstory. Once a guardian angel, he fell from grace after being consumed by the power of a mysterious sword that granted him immense strength. In the game, his sword is a central part of his character. Its design changes depending on the skin used, which serves as the main inspiration for creating multiple versions of this rig to reflect different aspects of Argus's identity.

## Available Variants

There are five sword rig variants available, each based on Argus's official skins. The shape, colors, and other visual details have been adapted to remain recognizable while fitting the stylized world of Minecraft. The available variants are:

- Dark Angel
- Light of Dawn
- Dark Draconic
- Catastrophe
- Malediction

This rig can be used in a wide range of animation projects that need a strong and distinctive weapon element. The download link can be found at the bottom of this page.
