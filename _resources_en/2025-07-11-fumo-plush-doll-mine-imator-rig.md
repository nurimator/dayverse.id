Fumo dolls are known for their cute and expressive charm across the internet, but what if they showed up in Minecraft? This rig lets you turn that idea into a fun animation project.

## Overview

This rig features Fumo-style plush dolls created for use in *Mine-imator* animation projects. It is designed to be easy to use in Minecraft-themed scenes and works well as a decorative element, a background character, or part of a light-hearted setup. Each model maintains the proportions and visual identity of real-life Fumo dolls while adapting to the blocky style of Minecraft animations.

Fumo plush dolls are chibi-style representations of characters from the *Touhou Project* series. Known for their soft and cute appearance, these dolls are a favorite among fans and often appear in various creative content across the internet. In this rig, the original look of each Fumo has been preserved while blending it with the blocky format of *Mine-imator* to keep the style simple and expressive.
