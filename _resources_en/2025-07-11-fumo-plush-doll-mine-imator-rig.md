## Overview

This rig features Fumo-style plush dolls created for use in *Mine-imator* animation projects. It is designed to be easy to use in Minecraft-themed scenes and works well as a decorative element, a background character, or part of a light-hearted setup. Each model maintains the proportions and visual identity of real-life Fumo dolls while adapting to the blocky style of Minecraft animations.

Fumo plush dolls are chibi-style representations of characters from the *Touhou Project* series. Known for their soft and cute appearance, these dolls are a favorite among fans and often appear in various creative content across the internet. In this rig, the original look of each Fumo has been preserved while blending it with the blocky format of *Mine-imator* to keep the style simple and expressive.

## Available Variants

There are three Fumo plush doll rigs available, each representing a well-known character from the *Touhou Project*. The rigs are carefully designed to capture the distinctive traits of each character, including hairstyle, outfit colors, and accessories.

- Cirno  
- Reimu Hakurei  
- Koishi Komeiji  

This rig is ideal for enhancing scenes with a casual, comedic, or slice-of-life tone. The download link can be found at the bottom of this page.
